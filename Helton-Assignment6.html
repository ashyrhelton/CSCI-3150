    <h1>My Favorite Video Game Series</h1>
    <p>Although I play pretty much every game under the sun, I have always enjoyed <strong>first person shooters</strong> the most. I grew up playing the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/" title="Call of Duty homepage">Call of Duty</a> series as a kid, and it has been one of my favorites ever since. </p>
